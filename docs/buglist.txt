  Problem: Procedural texture samples only black after manual data upload.
 Solution: GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER and GL_TEXTURE_MAX_FILTER must be set. 

  Problem: After binding GL_TEXTURE_2D and GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP shader doesn't
           work as expected. Water surface is dissapearing.
 Solution: Both of the textures were bound to GL_TEXTURE0 slot. It is required
           to manually select active slot using glActiveTexture and assign them
           to separate texture slots.

  Problem: BSpline derivative is calculated incorrectly. Near the end it loses
           accuracy or validity.
 Solution: Misinterpreted BSpline as BSpline with clamped knot vector.
